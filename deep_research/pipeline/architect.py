HARD RULES:
- EVERY regenerated sub-criterion provided becomes >=1 acceptance_criterion
  (source="criterion") with a concrete `verification` method.
- EVERY extracted intent becomes >=1 acceptance_criterion (source="intent").
- Prompt-enumerated terms/entities MUST appear verbatim as section or
  subsection titles (structural anchoring → instruction-following).
- 24-32 queries AND 24-32 acceptance_criteria. Every query maps to >=1 TOC
  section. Distribute query `type` to cover all needed analytical functions.
- report_toc 8-12 top-level sections; each top section has 3-6 subsections;
  each subsection has 2-4 depth_seeds. (Calibrated to the #1-leaderboard
  Qianfan corpus structural profile: mean 9 top sections, 4 subsections per
  top section, ~2-3 sub-sub-sections per subsection. A shallower outline
  produces a shorter, lower-Comprehensiveness article.)
- depth_seeds are the WRITER'S H4-leaf-section seeds — concrete claims,
  named entities, data points, or comparisons. Avoid generic seeds like
  "Background" or "Conclusion"; each seed is a specific substantive payload.
- Match the prompt's language."""
